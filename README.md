# 📝 Disease Prediction from Medical Data - CodeAlpha Machine Learning Internship

This repository contains my submission for **Task 4: Disease Prediction from Medical Data** as part of the **CodeAlpha Machine Learning Internship**.

---

## 📌 **Task Objective**

Build a model to **predict the possibility of diseases based on patient data** using classification algorithms.

---

## 🚀 **Technologies Used**

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 💻 **Project Workflow**

1. **Loaded the Breast Cancer dataset** from Scikit-learn.
2. **Explored the dataset**: shape, feature names, target classes.
3. **Preprocessed data**:
   - Split into train-test sets.
   - Scaled features using StandardScaler.
4. **Built a Random Forest Classifier model**.
5. **Trained and evaluated the model**:
   - Achieved **~97% test accuracy**.
   - Generated **classification report** with precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. **Visualized results** with a Confusion Matrix heatmap for clear insights.
